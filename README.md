Overview
This project automates the generation of academic timetables for educational institutions. It schedules lectures and labs for multiple divisions while ensuring conflict-free assignments of subjects and faculties. The program offers user-friendly inputs, displays the timetables in the console, and exports them to a color-coded Excel file.

Features
1) Custom Inputs: Configure divisions, time slots, subjects, faculties, and labs.
2) Randomized Scheduling: Ensures balanced subject and faculty distribution.
3) Conflict-Free Assignments: Prevents faculty overlap across slots.
4) Export to Excel: Saves timetables in a formatted, color-coded Excel file.
    Yellow: Lunch breaks.
    Green: Lab sessions.
